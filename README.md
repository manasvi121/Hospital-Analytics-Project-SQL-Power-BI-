# Hospital-Analytics-Project(SQL-Power-BI)
Project Overview

This repository contains a complete end-to-end Hospital Analytics project built using MySQL and Power BI Service (Browser). The project simulates a real-world healthcare analytics workflow where raw operational data is transformed into meaningful business insights.
The focus of this project is not just visualization, but the entire analytics lifecycle:
Designing a relational database
Writing analytical SQL queries
Preparing data for BI tools
Building interactive dashboards under real tool constraints
This project is internship-ready and resume-ready.

Power BI Dashboard

Dashboard Pages

Doctor Performance – Doctor-wise appointment load with specialization slicer
Revenue Analysis – Monthly revenue trends and KPI card
Patient Analytics – Visit frequency and patient category distribution
Treatment Analysis – Most common treatments performed

Power BI Workflow (Browser-Based)

SQL queries executed in MySQL
Analytical results exported as CSV files
CSV files uploaded to Power BI Service as semantic models
Visuals created using bar charts, line charts, pie charts, cards, and slicers

Key Insights

Identified high-workload doctors to support staffing and scheduling decisions
Observed monthly revenue patterns for financial analysis
Classified patients into New, Regular, and Frequent segments
Determined the most demanded treatments for operational planning

Business Objectives

The project answers the following business questions:

Which doctors are the most and least utilized?
How is hospital revenue trending over time?
What is the patient visit behavior and retention pattern?
Which treatments are most frequently performed?

Tools & Technologies Used

MySQL – Database creation, joins, aggregations, analytics queries
SQL – Data modeling, transformations, business logic
Power BI Service (Browser) – Dashboard creation and visualization
CSV / Excel – Intermediate data preprocessing (browser-compatible approach)

Note: Power BI Desktop was not used due to platform constraints. All modeling logic was handled in SQL and CSV preprocessing.
